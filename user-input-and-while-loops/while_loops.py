# A while loop in Python repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.
# syntax: while expression:
#           statement(s)

# Example 1: Print i as long as i is less than 6:
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1 # i = i + 1



#count form 1 to 5
current_number = 1 # start at 1
while current_number <= 5: # while loops as long as i is less than or equal to 5
    print(current_number)
    current_number +- 1
