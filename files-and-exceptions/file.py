#Reading from a file.
#An incredible amount of data is available in text files. Text files can contain weather data, traffic data, socioeconomic data, literary works, and more. Reading from a file is particularly useful in data analysis applications, but itâ€™s also applicable to any situation in which you want to analyze or modify information stored in a text file. For example, you can write a program that reads in the contents of a text file and rewrites the file with formatting that allows a browser to display it.

#reading the context of a file
#pi_digits.txt - contains pi to 30 decimal places with 10 decimal place per line
#path is the exact location of a file or folder on a system.
#python provides a module called pathlib that makes it easy to work with the file system.
#a module that provides specific functionality like this is often called a library. hence, pathlib is a library.
