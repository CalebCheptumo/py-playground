#Exceptions - a special Python class designed to held you respond to error s when they arise.
#Python uses special objects called exceptions to manage errors that arise during a program's execution.
#When an error occurs that makes Python unsure what to do next, it creates an exception object.
#if you dont handle the exception, the program will halt and show a traceback, which includes a report of the exception that was raised.
#Exceptions are handled with try-except blocks.
#A try-except block asks Python to do something, but it also tells Python what to do if an exception is raised.
#When you use try-except blocks, your programs will continue running even if things start to go wrong.


#Handling the ZeroDivisionError Exception
#When you try to divide by zero, Python raises an exception because it canâ€™t carry out the division.
