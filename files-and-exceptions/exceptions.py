#Exceptions - a special Python class designed to held you respond to error s when they arise.
#Python uses special objects called exceptions to manage errors that arise during a program's execution.
#When an error occurs that makes Python unsure what to do next, it creates an exception object.
#if you dont handle the exception, the program will halt and show a traceback, which includes a report of the exception that was raised.
#Exceptions are handled with try-except blocks.
#A try-except block asks Python to do something, but it also tells Python what to do if an exception is raised.
#When you use try-except blocks, your programs will continue running even if things start to go wrong.


#Handling the ZeroDivisionError Exception
#When you try to divide by zero, Python raises an exception because it canâ€™t carry out the division.


#using try-except blocks
#write try-except block to handle the exception that was raised.
#syntax: try:
#               print(5 / 0)
#        except ZeroDivisionError:
#               print("You can't divide by zero!")
#The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try block.

#we put the line that cause the error inside try block.
#python skips over the except block if the code in the try block causes an error.
#python looks for an except block telling it how to respond to the error.



#using exceptions to prevent crashes
#prompt for more valid input instead of crashing.
#example: division calculator

#the else block
#we can make the program more error resistant by wrapping the line that might produce errors in a try-except block.
#the error occurs on the line that performs the division so that where we'll put the try-except block
#the else block runs if the code in the try block runs successfully.


#handing the FileNotFoundError exception
#the file you are looking for might:
#1. be in a different location
#2. have a different name
#3. not exist at all
#4. be in a different format
#you can handle the FileNotFoundError exception using a try-except block.


#analyzing text
#you can use the split() method to split a string into a list of elements.

#working with multiple files
# count_words() function that counts the approximate number of words in a file.
#count_words() function takes a filename as an argument and tries to count the number of words in the file.
